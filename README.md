# CSE478-Group


## Project Overview

"The Cost of Living: Struggling to Make Ends Meet" is a data visualization project aimed at highlighting the economic challenges faced by various income groups across the United States. Using interactive visualizations, this project illustrates the disparities in income, cost of living, and housing affordability.

## Current Prototype (v0.1-wip)

### Implemented Features

- Basic web interface layout with HTML and CSS.
- Create layout of index.html  
- 'description/overview of story'
- 'team member names and emails'
- 'include designated areas for visuals'
- 'include headers for each visual'
- 'include information about each visual describing what it represents'
Create visual 1
- Interactive map showing income disparities across states
Create visual 2 
- Scatter plot correlating cost of living with median incomes
- shows distribution of different metrics across states
Create visual 3 
- Box-and-whisker plot showing the distribution of median incomes across the U.S.
- shows distribution of incomes (highlighting median, quartiles)
Create visual 4
- Radial progress charts showing the percentage of households at different income levels.
Create visual 5 
- Connected scatter plot showing the relationship between median income and unemployment rates over time.
Create visual 6 
- Description of the innovative visualization, which could be an extension or a novel type.
- 'Sourced data sets to '
- 'Implemented 6 starter visualizations using group21.js'


### Pending Features
- Initial data loading and processing scripts
- Add working functionality of charts (legends, proper display, etc)
- Enhanced interactivity, including tooltips and linking between different views.

### Data Source and Preprocessing

- Original Data Source: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/cost-of-living-by-state/
- Data Preprocessing: [Describe any preprocessing steps like cleaning, aggregation, or transformation applied to the data.]
- At this point, we are trying to select the most relevant features for analysis.
- Also, our group is trying to convert categorical data into a numerical format.
- Our group is planning to split the data into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of predictive models.
